1]JDK: JDK is used to compile and run the java code.
JRE: JRE(java run time environment)is used to run the code,without jre the code will not execute.
JVM: jvm contains both jdk and jre

2] operations of jvm:
-check the byte code stream line by line
-compile the byte code
-interprit the code


3] because of the java development kit, the code can be write anywhere,compile anywhere and execute anywhere irrespective of operating system.

4] class is a non primitive data type,which will provide a way to write our code

5] keywords are java predefined.example: static,.out,main

6] variable is reserved space in the memory to hold the data type which we are going to store.

7]local variables are used within the main method or instance

8]which is aslo called as static variable


9] to define the type of the data we are going to used
there are 2 types of datatype
1.primitive (int,char,boolean,short,float,double,long,byte)
2.non primitive(String,System)

10]main method is a entry point for executing the program

11]class EvenOrOdd{
public static void main(String[] number){
int number=n;
if(n%2==0){
System.out.print("The given number is even:"+a);
}
else
System.out.print("the given number is odd:"+a);
}
}
